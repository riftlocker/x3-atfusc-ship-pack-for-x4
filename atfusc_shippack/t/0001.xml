			<t id="3">The Tyr-class battleship of the AGI Task Force was once the heavy weapons platform of the Earth Fleet, capable of leveling entire Xenon stations and capital ships of its time. Decommissioned along with several ships of the USC and ATF, its role was taken over by its successor - the Asgard-class battleship.\n\nAmidst the Jump Gate shutdown and the founding of the Terran Protectorate, a contingent of Terran military engineers banded together to update several USC/ATF designs to modern standards, with the Tyr having its vertical-facing turrets replaced with modular medium turrets, and also seeing a dramatic increase in size at the cost of manoeuvrability to capture the intimidating force projection of the Terrans.\n\nAlthough the blueprint was finished and approved, the Protectorate decided to keep deploying the Asgard due to its flexibility in the new theater of war and lower operating cost. On the other hand, pilots in good standing with the Protectorate are able to obtain a copy of the blueprint for a hefty sum.</t>

			<t id="3">One of the biggest ships in the known universe, the Valhalla doubled as the AGI Task Force's flagship and command centre. Easily dwarfing every other battleship of the Commonwealth and even the Xenon of its time, its presence alone was greatly feared by the enemies of Earth, not to mention its various capabilities. It was once said that the Valhalla knows of everything that moves in Terran space... until the Torus Incident occured. That, the Jump Gate shutdown, and the restructuring of the Terran military would eventually see the platform retired from service.\n\nSeveral Terran admirals have contested the decommissioning of the ship, seeing it too valuable to simply put out of the picture. While debates on whether the ship should be put back into service were happening, veteran ATF shipwrights covertly worked on overhauling the aging Valhalla to modern standards, upgrading it with massive shield and weapon generators which would allow the ship to serve as a mobile stronghold. When rumours broke out about the updated Valhalla years later, the Protectorate had already approved of the blueprint but have not yet decided on whether it should be redeployed.\n\nThe ship is so massive that the Terrans have devised its own unique "XXL-size" multipurpose bay, the only place where the Valhalla can safely dock and perform repairs/upgrades. Such power comes with great responsibility and cost, and as such, only the closest allies of Earth are welcome to try and construct one of their own if they are willing to make a significant "donation" to the Terran cause.</t>

			<t id="3">Deployed by the United Space Command at the apex of the Terran Conflict, the Kyoto was the USC's premier capital ship, a counterpart to their sister service's Valhalla. Bolstering a sheer-but-sleek design, the Kyoto maintains a small broadside profile, easily allowing its turrets' line of fire to be larger than most ships of its class while also being harder to hit.\n\nOver the years following the gate shutdown, the design was then improved upon during their isolation. Outfitted with classified engine housing technology as well as several changes to its carrier capabilities, the Kyoto was redesigned to be a rapid-response battlecarrier allowing it to achieve great speeds for its size as well as deploy entire fighter squadrons at a moment's notice without sacrificing an inch of its anti-capital ship capabilities.\n\nThere are rumors that the ship was never decommissioned - that it is merely being upgraded constantly due to the sudden rise in Terran breakthroughs, although the Protectorate has no comment on the matter. The blueprints of an older version however are available to the closest allies of Earth, under close watch by High Command.</t>

			<t id="3">Once the standard heavy frigate of the AGI Task Force, the Aegir played an essential role in the Terran's counter-AGI effort and later on, the conflict between the Community of Planets. Due to advancements with the M7C frigates, the Aegir was eventually decommissioned after the development of the Falx-class frigate, carrying the features of both the M7 and M7C.\n\nWhen the Protectorate contracted several shipwrights and engineers to build the next-generation destroyer, the Aegir was used as a base by one of the participating bodies. Virtually unchanged, the upgraded Aegir was armed with a more powerful generator, allowing it to mount a few high-power turrets which its predecessor was unable to. Improvements were also made to its anti-fighter abilities, trading the deck turrets for smaller medium ones.\n\nAlthough the improved Syn-class destroyer would eventually end up being deployed by the Protectorate, the Aegir blueprints remain available to eligible citizens of Sol.</t>

			<t id="3">A legendary ship once known for singlehandedly deciding the outcome of a battle through sheer missile barrages, the M7M Skirnir of the AGI Task Force was a highly controversial ship among the Community of Planets as it had the capability to destroy entire sectors with the Terran-made Shadow Missiles of the time, which some captains of the USC and ATF had no problem using against the Argon primarily at the height of the Terran Conflict.\n\nWhen the gates re-opened, the need for such a heavy missile warship was not seen due to the relatively peaceful setting. Despite this, the Terrans, having endured the AGI attack and the destruction of the Torus Aeternal by the Argons, have devised a comprehensive contingency plan. For this purpose the Skirnir, long decommissioned, was used as a platform and received an overhaul effectively turning it into a heavy missile destroyer. Along with upgrading its aging missile barrage system, the Skirnir was retrofitted with the newest Terran components designed to balance out its role as a missile destroyer, dedicated to engaging capital ships and stations at a range with heavy warheads.</t>

			<t id="8">Properties: Heavy | Guided \nLaunch Range: 22 km \n\nConsidered to be the spiritual successor to the old Terran Shadow Missile, the Laevateinn Multi-Missile was conceived as a collaborative project between the USC and the ATF during the interbellum. The warhead consists of highly-advanced tracking systems controlled by the Skirnir's guidance system, enabling the pilot to launch the warhead at extreme ranges. Improvements were also made to its payload - by combining point-singularity technology with antimatter reactions, the warhead creates a small distortion in spacetime after detonation, severely damaging anything within its wake.</t>

			<t id="3">Ancient by today's standards, the Vidar-class corvette of the AGI Task Force was long superseded by the Vali and eventually the Protectorate-issued Katana. What it lacks on modern ship technology, it makes up with its very high manoeuvrability.\n\nAlthough the design itself is very old, a few Terran engineers have found a way to overhaul the ship to an extent, bringing it almost on par with the newest-generation corvettes. The internal systems are still dated, but upgrades to its engine systems allow it to stand out from the rest of the M-class ships.</t>

			<t id="3">The first ship to make contact with the Commonwealth after the Earth gate was activated and also the ones to save their fleet from the Kha'ak at Heretic's End, the Odin-class battlecruiser had long been a staple of the Earth Fleet and the AGI Task Force. By the events of the Terran Conflict its capabilities were considered to be highly advanced, being able to stand against destroyers and battleships better compared to other ships of its class.\n\nDue to the events of the Jump Gate shutdown, the Terran Protectorate saw little use for such a heavy carrier and as such, the Tokyo became the mainstay carrier of their fleets. Several decades of peace would see the former ATF M1 carrier rust away, but fate had another plan for the ship as the gates once again re-opened in 2973. The Odin was then modified to emphasize its heavy carrier role, sacrificing its fighter bays for corvette-sized bays.\n\nUnlike most of the updated pre-shutdown-era ATF ships, it is currently the only one to be sold directly by Terran shipyards. The Protectorate decided that its own Tokyo-class carriers could synergize with the Odin-class heavy carriers and have allowed sale of it to eligible allies of Earth.</t>

			<t id="3">Based from the chassis of the last-generation Tokyo, the Mobile Mining Base-Ship was the designated deep-space support miner of the Terrans. It served as a base ship for other mining vessels which would stock minerals into the ship to increase the total payload per run. When the gates shut down, demand for minerals dwindled due to the war economy stagnating which would see the ship phased out.\n\nWhen the gates re-opened in 2973, it was put back into service with notable changes to its design, a few of which include the capital-grade turrets being replaced with modern L-sized mining turrets and having its docks reduced for greater storage and gas mining capabilities to support the ever-growing Protectorate's interventionist campaign against the Xenon.</t>

			<t id="3">Designated as a possible replacement for the Odin, the Woden was designed to fulfill a flexible role as part-battleship and part-carrier causing Terran officials to question its capabilities as a dual-purpose capital ship. As the Terran Conflict waned, the demand for such a heavy carrier was not seen and like the Odin, the next-generation Tokyo would eventually take over both of their carrier roles.\n\nUnlike the Odin which was revamped into a slightly different role with their redesigns, the Woden kept its purpose intact as an S-ship battlecarrier that can be relegated to battleship duty when the need arises. Boasting several large turrets and a spacious landing area, it can be a force to be reckoned with.</t>
